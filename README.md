# CallSense 

**AI-Powered Customer Call Analysis Tool**

---

##  Problem Statement

Customer support teams struggle to identify recurring issues from large volumes of call recordings, leading to:

- **Time-consuming manual analysis** of customer complaints  
- **Inability to prioritize** which problems need immediate attention

CallSense solves this by automatically analyzing support call recordings to extract and rank the most common customer problems, enabling businesses to address systemic issues quickly and reduce future complaint volume.

##  How It Works

1. **Audio Upload** - Users upload customer call recordings (`.mp3`, `.wav`, `.m4a`)
2. **Speech-to-Text Conversion** - Cloud API transcribes audio to text with high accuracy
3. **AI Problem Analysis** - Analysing based on extracted keyword
4. **Problem Ranking** - System ranks and displays top 5-10 recurring problems with frequency scores

**Workflow:**
